# Thundr
Thundr App - React Native

Building an app that allows for more effective brainstorming. Currently learning React Native
and developing the UI and screen flows, with minimal backend functionality. 

TODOS:

- Add option in ... menu button on HomeScreen to display info for the selected brainstorm.
- Create confirmation modal to tell user to check email for password reset
- Adding idea to existing brainstorm adds to all brainstorms.

# Thundr
Thundr App - React Native

Building an app that allows for more effective brainstorming. Currently learning React Native
and developing the UI and screen flows, with minimal backend functionality. 

TODOS:

- Create confirmation modal to tell user to check email for password reset
- Clean up PastBrainstormScreen, it's a bit messy.
- Change statusBarStyle to 'dark-mode' when opening search modal on home screen.
- Adding idea to existing brainstorm adds to all brainstorms.
